    "verbal_hint": "Contrast labeled vs unlabeled data.",
    "nonverbal_hint": "Use two fingers to distinguish the two types.",
    "ideal_response": "Supervised learning uses labeled data to predict outcomes; unsupervised finds structure without labels."

    "id": 3,
    "prompt": "What techniques would you use to handle missing data in a dataset?",
    "verbal_hint": "Mention deletion, mean/median imputation, and model-based methods.",
    "nonverbal_hint": "Maintain eye contact when listing options.",
    "ideal_response": "Options include dropping rows, mean or median imputation, or using algorithms like KNN imputer."

    "verbal_hint": "Discuss metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC.",
    "nonverbal_hint": "Use open hand gestures to emphasize each metric.",
    "ideal_response": "Evaluate using a confusion matrix, then compute accuracy, precision, recall, and F1; consider ROC AUC for imbalance."

    "verbal_hint": "Define sampling distribution and normal approximation.",
    "nonverbal_hint": "Nod softly when stating the theorem.",
    "ideal_response": "It states that the sampling distribution of the mean approaches normality as sample size increases, enabling inference."

    "verbal_hint": "Focus on stakeholder needs and clear visuals.",
    "nonverbal_hint": "Point to an imaginary chart as you explain.",
    "ideal_response": "I’d gather stakeholder requirements, choose 3–5 KPIs, use bar and line charts, and ensure interactive filters."

    "verbal_hint": "Mention L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties.",
    "nonverbal_hint": "Stand tall and speak deliberately.",
    "ideal_response": "Regularization adds a penalty to large coefficients (L1 or L2) to prevent overfitting and improve generalization."
